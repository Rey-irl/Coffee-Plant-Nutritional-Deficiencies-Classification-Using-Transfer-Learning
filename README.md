# ☕ Coffee Plant Nutritional Deficiencies Classification using Transfer Learning

This project applies **deep learning** and **transfer learning** techniques to detect and classify **nutritional deficiencies** in coffee plant leaves using image data. The goal is to support **smallholder farmers** with early detection tools to optimize crop nutrition and improve coffee yield and quality.

## 📌 Project Overview

Nutritional deficiencies in coffee plants often go unnoticed, overshadowed by more visible pests and diseases. However, lack of nutrients like **Boron, Calcium, Iron, Magnesium**, and others significantly affects productivity. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and pre-trained models, this project builds an automated image classification system.

### 🔍 Objective

- Identify 10 categories of nutritional deficiency (including **Healthy** class).
- Use transfer learning to overcome the challenge of limited labeled data.
- Compare performance across five CNN architectures.
